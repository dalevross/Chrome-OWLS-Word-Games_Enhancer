# Chrome-OWLS-Word-Games_Enhancer
This extension offers a one click option to view remaining tiles in the Lexulous, Wordscraper and Scrabble games played on facebook.

========================
** Important **
Removing the extension deletes all notes!
========================

An owl will appear in the browser bar when the user browses to the games page. Clicking on the owl while in a game will display the available tiles.
